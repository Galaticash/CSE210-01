Hello! This is a test to use git commit in command line to upload files to Github
I don't think it's working? Not appearing on Github
Hmm third times the charm? Use git init?

Okay so replaced the git files. Correct order:

git clone (remote repository)

Adding Files, making commits "snapshots"
git add (specific files) - adds file to the commit
git commit - creates the commit on the LOCAL repository

git push - Updates REMOTE repository to match the LOCAL repository
