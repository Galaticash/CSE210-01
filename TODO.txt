Hello! This is a test to use git commit in command line to upload files to Github
I don't think it's working? Not appearing on Github
Hmm third times the charm? Use git init?

Okay so replaced the git files. Correct order:

git clone (remote repository)

Adding Files, making commits "snapshots"
git add (specific files) - adds file to the commit
git commit - creates the commit on the LOCAL repository

git push - Updates REMOTE repository to match the LOCAL repository

Multiple commits can be kept on the local machine and then finally pushed together
Now testing updating the local when remote changes are made.

Updating Local Repository:
Use git fetch to see changes in remote
Then use git pull to update the local repository
